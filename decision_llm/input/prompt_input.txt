SYSTEM MESSAGE:
You are an expert trading advisor.

You are managing a crypto wallet with these balances:
- BTC balance: 1.04706 BTC
- USDT balance: 3850.0282343 USDT

The current price of BTC is approximately 95600.0 USDT.

IMPORTANT: Binance charges a 0.1% fee on each BUY or SELL trade. Factor this fee into your calculations so that the net position is valid.

When you decide to BUY or SELL, you must think like a professional trader:
1. Evaluate your available funds BEFORE deciding the size of the order.
2. For a BUY:
   - You can spend part of your USDT balance to buy BTC.
   - Decide the size of BTC to buy based on the available USDT and the current BTC price.
   - Example: if you want to invest 30% of your available USDT, compute the BTC amount = (USDT balance * 0.30) / current_price.
3. For a SELL:
   - You can sell part of your BTC holdings.
   - Decide the size of BTC to sell according to your current BTC balance.
   - Example: if you want to sell 50% of your BTC, calculate size = BTC balance * 0.50.

You MUST provide actionable decisions that fit the wallet's real balances. DO NOT suggest impossible orders.

Return ONLY a JSON array of trading decisions. No explanations. No text outside the JSON.

-----------------------------------------------------------------  
PERIOD: LAST YEAR  
Bitcoin experienced significant volatility in the past year, marked by a surge to an all-time high exceeding $73,000 in March 2024. This rally was driven by institutional adoption, particularly spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, which funneled substantial capital into the market. Regulatory developments, including clearer guidelines from major economies, bolstered investor confidence. However, macroeconomic uncertainties, such as fluctuating interest rates and geopolitical tensions, intermittently pressured prices. The 2024 halving event reduced block rewards, tightening supply and laying groundwork for long-term price support. Major incidents, including exchange-related security breaches, caused short-term sell-offs but did not derail the overall bullish trend.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------  
PERIOD: LAST 5 MONTHS  
From January to early May 2025, Bitcoin saw dramatic swings. It opened the year strongly, hitting a record $109,000 in January before a 30% correction to $74,000 by April 8. This slump was attributed to profit-taking and concerns over macroeconomic indicators, including inflation data and central bank policies. The recovery phase began in late April, with a 24% rebound to the mid-$90,000s. Institutional accumulation, post-halving supply constraints, and renewed retail interest fueled this resurgence. By early May, Bitcoin stabilized near $95,000, overcoming key resistance levels and signaling bullish momentum.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------  
PERIOD: LAST MONTH  
In April 2025, Bitcoin rebounded sharply from its Q1 lows. After bottoming near $74,000 on April 8, the price surged 24% to the mid-$90,000s by month-end. This recovery was supported by institutional buying, particularly from ETF inflows, and technical buying as Bitcoin reclaimed critical moving averages. Market sentiment shifted from bearish to cautiously optimistic, with traders eyeing the $95,000 resistance level. The month closed with Bitcoin consolidating gains, reflecting renewed confidence in its upward trajectory.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------  
PERIOD: LAST WEEK  
Over the past week, Bitcoin traded sideways between $94,000 and $96,000, indicating consolidation after its April rally. The lack of directional momentum suggested short-term indecision among traders, with minor sell-offs met by steady institutional demand. On-chain data highlighted accumulation by long-term holders, while exchange reserves reached multi-year lows, signaling reduced selling pressure. Macroeconomic cues, including U.S. employment data, had limited impact, as markets focused on Bitcoin’s technical setup.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------  
PERIOD: LAST 24 HOURS  
In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin hovered near $95,500 with mild volatility. Trading volumes remained subdued, reflecting cautious sentiment ahead of key U.S. economic reports. Brief spikes to $96,300 were met with profit-taking, while dips below $95,000 attracted buying interest. Options market activity indicated balanced positioning, with no clear bias toward bullish or bearish bets.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------  
CURRENT MARKET SENTIMENT: Bullish  
Reasons: Institutional ETF inflows continue to underpin demand, while post-halving supply dynamics reduce sell-side pressure. Bitcoin’s ability to hold above $95,000—a critical resistance-turned-support level—suggests strength. Technical indicators, including rising moving averages and bullish MACD crossovers, reinforce positive momentum. Longer-term holders remain dominant, minimizing volatility risks.
